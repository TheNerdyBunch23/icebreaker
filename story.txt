I was driving my BMW down the street.
I was cruising next to a BMW in my Porsche.
I was heading near the Ratskeller to a great Bratwurst place on the Haupstra√üe.
Afterwards, I went to work to make some brot.
But before I made the brot, I was sure to put on my Lederhose.
Then I looked up and I was in Berlin, "What the f-?".
At least the building I'm in has Klimaanlage.
